# DNS Record Lookup
[![Build Status](https://cloud.drone.io/api/badges/cconover/drl/status.svg)](https://cloud.drone.io/cconover/drl)

`drl` is a command line utility for performing DNS lookups. It provides a simple syntax, and easy-to-read results.

*drl is a reference project for me to learn about writing CLI tools in Go, so please be gentle with critiques.*
